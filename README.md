# Swarm Resource Collection Simulation

This is a Python-based simulation of a swarm of agents collecting and defending resources. The simulation showcases various swarm behavior algorithms, resource allocation, and agent coordination.

## Features
- Agents with different roles (collectors and opposers)
- Resources with different weight classes (light, medium, heavy)
- Swarm behavior rules for cohesion, separation, and alignment
- Collector agents working together to gather resources
- Opposer agents attempting to steal resources from collectors
- Dynamic resource spawning and simulation events

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swarm-resource-collection.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
